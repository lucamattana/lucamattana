### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Luca Mattana Besozzi

I'm a FullStack web developer based in Buenos Aires Argentina, I am looking to get my feet wet in the world of software development
and ready for any new challange that comes my way. I always had an interest in technology but never really did anything proactive
towards it, now, since I've finished SoyHenry's bootcamp I feel very eager to start my journey.

Technologies I use:

- Javascript
- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Redux
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize
